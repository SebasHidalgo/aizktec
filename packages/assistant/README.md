Welcome to the **AI Chatbot** built for the **Aizktec Project**, This chatbot is designed to assist developers by answering questions and providing guidance while working on the Aizktec project. It leverages **Vercel's SDK** and **OpenAI's powerful language models** to deliver intelligent, context-aware responses.

Built with **Next.js**, this chatbot is lightweight, fast, and easy to deploy. Whether you're stuck on a technical issue, need clarification on project architecture, or want to explore best practices, this chatbot is here to help.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Assistance**: Built on OpenAI's advanced language models, the chatbot provides accurate and context-aware responses to technical and project-related questions.
- **Seamless Integration**: Utilizes Vercel's SDK for easy deployment and scalability.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Designed specifically for developers working on the Aizktec project, offering tailored support.
- **Real-Time Responses**: Delivers instant answers to queries, saving time and improving productivity.
- **Next.js Optimized**: Built with Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes.
- **No Node.js Backend Required**: Uses Next.js API routes for backend functionality.

## How It Works

The AI Chatbot is built using the following technologies:

1. **Next.js**: Handles frontend rendering, API routes, and serverless functions.
2. **OpenAI API**: Powers the chatbot's natural language processing and response generation.
3. **Vercel SDK**: Simplifies deployment and scaling.

### Workflow:

1. A developer asks a question through the chat interface.
2. The question is sent to a Next.js API route (`/api/chat`).
3. The API route forwards the question to OpenAI's API for processing.
4. OpenAI generates a response, which is sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user.

## Usage

Once the chatbot is set up, you can interact with it by typing questions related to the Aizktec project. For example:

- **Technical Questions**:

  - _"How do I set up the database for the Aizktec project?"_
  - _"What are the best practices for API authentication in this project?"_

- **Project-Specific Questions**:

  - _"Can you explain the architecture of the Aizktec project?"_
  - _"How do I integrate the payment gateway?"_

- **General Development Questions**:
  - _"How do I optimize React performance?"_
  - _"What’s the best way to handle errors in Next.js?"_

```javascript
import { useState } from "react";

export default function Home() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState("");
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);

  const handleSend = async () => {
    if (!input.trim()) return;

    const userMessage = { role: "user", content: input };
    setMessages((prev) => [...prev, userMessage]);

    const response = await fetch("/api/chat", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({ message: input }),
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    const botMessage = { role: "bot", content: data.reply };
    setMessages((prev) => [...prev, botMessage]);

    set
```
